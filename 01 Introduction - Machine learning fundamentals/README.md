This lecture will cover basic machine learning methodology, the logistic regression algorithm, and the k Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

After attending this lecture and reading the corresponding part of the book, I expect you to be able to:

Explain what is meant by the term Machine Learning (ML)
Explain what is meant by supervised vs. unsupervised learning
Explain the overall difference between classification and regression
Describe the "train-test" methodology
Train a logistic regression (LR) and k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm on a dataset in sklearn
Explain the principles behind the kNN algorithm
Explain the key ideas behind logistic regression, and implement a logistic regression classifier in python.
Explain the concept of “maximum likelihood” and how it is used.
Explain and use L1 and L2 regularization in the context of logistic regression, and discuss the difference between these approaches, as well as the importance of the hyperparameter C.
Discuss advantages and disadvantages of logistic regression.
Explain what is meant by the "hyperparameters" of an algorithm
